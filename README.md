Have you ever wondered what it is like to be a crow? Well now you have the answer! Fly above a magic garden, make crow friends, and lead your murder into a one-sided battle with death itself. Not even the grim reapers can survive the never-ending blasts of bird shit -- assert dominance over mortality!

This singleplayer game was made for a 5-hour game jam hosted by CyberSoc in collaboration with my sister and with the help of free pizza. This is a top-down 2-D shooter game where you are a crow who poops on grim reapers using the space button to evade your own demise. when in proximity of a sitting crow, the crow is added to your murder, increasing your poop firepower. A kill counter is incremented with every reaper death. Currently there is no win condition and only one level due to the limited time I had to develop this game.
